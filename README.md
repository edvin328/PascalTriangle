### PascalTriangle solutions in different programming languages

In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients.
In much of the Western world, it is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, 
although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in India, Persia (Iran), China, Germany, and Italy.

Each number in Pascal's triangle is the numbers directly above it added together.
